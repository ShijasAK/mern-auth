Setup the Database 
Connected Node.js to MongoDB atlas that is cloud databse storage using mongoose npm libraryused.
used bcrypt to hash the password received from request body.
Tested the Register Endpoints using Postman API testing tool.
Created the Login Endpoint, where i utilized jwt (json web token).
Tested login end points by using the tokens generated.
need to handle CORS errors. This will allow the user in the frontend to consume the APIs that we have created without any problem.
I tried to host the backend using heroku but unfortunately I could not do it as the time is going by I suddenly started going on to create the responsive User Interface.
So in backend , in summary,  started by setting up a database on MongoDB Atlas. 
Then  proceeded to create two endpoints – register and login – to enable us to input a user into the database and crosscheck if the user exists. 
Next,  we have seen how you can protect endpoints and how to handle CORS errors. 

Started developing frontend using javascript library React.
connected the UI to the endpoints using axios npm library.
set up the project and gave it a name.
created components like register.js, Login.js...
Logged in a user.
set up the Route.
Made API call using the useEffect Hooks
Unfortunately I could not host the frontend as i mentioned earlier that I could not host the backend so there I coud not generate an URL.
Moreover since the time is limited I tried to solve many problems as much as I can.
